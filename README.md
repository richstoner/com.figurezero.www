Figure Zero is an experimental take on the traditional Figure 1. We've used modern technologies to create a new kind of research communication, available as web and iOS applications. The technology is a core component in a larger medical education platform being developed in partnership with the Distributed Health Lab at UCSD.

A recent push for online and open publication has yielded an opportunity to create rich, interactive presentations of scientific research. Unlike static images found in traditional publications, FigureZero is an interactive zoomable canvas on which authors can map regions of interest, create annotations, and embed citations to share with other researchers. A single FigureZero figure can contain hundreds of annotations, each unique and capable of encapsulating a variety of formats (PubMed ID, D.O.I., YouTube, and Vimeo).

FigureZero was built to fill a need of researchers and educators worldwide. We welcome feedback and community involvement throughout our beta test (Oct. 1 - Dec. 31, 2012). For more information, follow us @figurezero or email us at contact (at) figurezero.com

We hope you find it useful!
